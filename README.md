# üîç Forensics/Steganography: Metadata Hidden

---

## Problem Description

I discovered this file during an investigation. Someone is trying to hide information in the **metadata** (information about the data). Can you do a little forensic investigating... there seems to be something odd about the **camera description**.

You will need the **`Arch.jpg`** file for this challenge.

## Task

Your objective is to uncover the hidden information (the **flag**) contained within the metadata of the `Arch.jpg` image file.

Start by inputting the `Arch.jpg` file into your forensic tool (e.g., [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)).

## Hints

* Use an operation to **EXTRACT** the metadata from the file (specifically **EXIF**).
* The suspicious information is hidden in a field typically used for camera description. In image metadata, this often corresponds to the **Make** or **Model** tag.
